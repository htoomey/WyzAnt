A few tips regarding Program 3:

Be sure to change the loop in the server program to read until the end of each file.

Each file has a different size, the 10KB file will be sent in 10, 1000 bytes packets, the 20KB file will be sent in 20, 1000 byte files, etc

Also note that the TCP header has a min of 20bytes and a max of 60bytes.

You will need to look at the wireshark capture to see how many data packets were sent - take note to see how many pure acks, syn, and fin packets or even resends there are - these are all control packets. The summary page found on Statistics, "File Capture Page" will list the total number of packets and will not categorize them.

Be sure to include calculations - how did you find the number of bytes for overhead etc.

Hope this helps - the quiz is on chapter 5 if you weren't aware of that already.
